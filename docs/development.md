title: Development Model
description: How development is structured and constrained in the ChiroStretch project.
---

This project is intentionally structured to separate concerns between the frontend application and the WordPress backend.

Local development prioritizes safety, predictability, and clear boundaries over convenience. Not all production behavior is reproduced locally, and that is by design.

This documentation describes the development constraints and assumptions that keep the system maintainable as it grows.
