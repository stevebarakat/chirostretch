title: Zustand over XState
description: Why Zustand was chosen for state management instead of XState.
---

This project originally evaluated XState for client-side state management but ultimately adopted Zustand.

The primary concern was not capability, but long-term maintainability and cognitive overhead. While XState provides powerful modeling tools, it encourages global state machines that are difficult to refactor incrementally as product requirements evolve.

Zustand was chosen because it:

- Aligns closely with React’s mental model
- Keeps state colocated and explicit
- Avoids abstract event systems where simple function calls suffice
- Makes debugging and refactoring easier over time

This decision favors clarity and composability over formal state modeling. If application complexity shifts toward heavily asynchronous or protocol-driven workflows, this decision may be revisited.
